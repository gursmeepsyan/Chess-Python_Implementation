# Chess-Python_Implementation


Win/lose (checkmate) conditions: After each move, the condition for check is checked and the player is informed if they are in check. 
 - If check is true, the checkmate condition is also checked to see if the game is over. Turns continue until checkmate becomes true. It is also indicated when a player is in check.

 - When the player inputs coordinates, our game will first check the validity of the input format for the beginning and end coordinates and then it will check the validity of the move itself. If the format or the move is invalid, the user is told to try again.

 - Once the move is approved as valid and goes through, the computer carries out the result of the move. The computer updates the graphics accordingly, and then it prompts the other player to move. This is done by updating the main list and reprinting the board.
